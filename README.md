# Seam Carving
Seam Carving for Content Aware Image Resizing and Object Removal

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to perform content-aware image resizing for both reduction and expansion and image object removal with seam carving operator. This allows image to be resized without losing or distorting meaningful content from scaling. The code in this repository and technique described below is an implementation of the algorithm presented in [Avidan and Shamir](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2007_fall/hw/proj2/imret.pdf) and [Avidan, Rubinstein, and Shamir](http://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2008-064.pdf) algorithms.
